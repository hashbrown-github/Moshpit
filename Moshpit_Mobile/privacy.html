                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all information, including personal information collected through the Hashbrown Systems’ Service. For the purpose of this

                    which individual identities or other personal information have been removed. This Privacy Policy, in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of 
                    aggregate and non-personal information, and we may share such data about our users with third parties for various purposes. This Privacy Policy is part of
